        <p>If you want to disable cookies, you can do it by accessing the settings of your internet browser. (Provide links for cookie settings for major internet browsers).</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-blue-500"><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></h3>
        <p>Our website contains links that lead to other websites. If you click on these links&nbsp;<strong><a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900" title="Fancy Text Generator" href='https://fancytext.cf'>fancytext.cf</a></strong>&nbsp;is not held responsible for your data and privacy protection. Visiting those websites is not governed by this privacy policy agreement. Make sure to read the privacy policy documentation of the website you go to from our website.</p>
        <p class="my-2"><strong>Restricting the Collection of your Personal Data</strong></p>
        <p>At some point, you might wish to restrict the use and collection of your personal data. You can achieve this by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>When you are filling the forms on the website, make sure to check if there is a box that you can leave unchecked, if you don't want to disclose your personal information.</li>
        <li>If you have already agreed to share your information with us, feel free to contact us via email and we will be more than happy to change this for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong><a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900" title="Fancy Text Generator" href='https://fancytext.cf'>fancytext.cf</a></strong> will not lease, sell, or distribute your personal information to any third parties unless we have your permission. We might do so if the law forces us. Your personal information will be used when we need to send you promotional materials if you agree to this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-blue-500"><strong>Log Files</strong></h3>
        <p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files includes your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-blue-500"><strong>Cookies and Web Beacons</strong></h3>
        <p>We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>
        <p>We also use third party advertisements on&nbsp;<strong><a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900" title="Fancy Text Generator" href='https://fancytext.cf'>fancytext.cf</a></strong>&nbsp;to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-blue-500"><strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong></h3>
        <p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).</p>
        <p>The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers, or credit card numbers.</p>
        <p>You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx</a></p>
        <p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>
        <p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4 text-2xl text-blue-500"><strong>Contacting Website Owners</strong></h3>
        <p class="pt-3">If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a class="text-blue-700 hover:text-blue-900" href="https://www.fancytext.cf/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-custom-class="link">https://www.fancytext.cf/contact</a></p>
